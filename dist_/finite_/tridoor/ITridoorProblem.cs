	/// then we need to treat this as a grame theory, as the two player: the host, and the audience take strategy in a sequence. What's the best situation? Is that an equilibrium solution?
	/// then we can explain it using information theory:
	///		1) whether the host knows;
	///		how much and in what way he can transfer the knowledge
	///		how the audience take advantage of that info
	///		2) whether the audience knows the host knows and the host transfers the correct info.
